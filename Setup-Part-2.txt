I deeply apologize for this package list salad. :(
I was working on another project that required compiling and building packages in fits and starts and now not sure all are necessary.
If some are not available it's ok.

AI is not working. I disabled pwngrid but may work for you.

I had issues getting GPS to work with plugins.
I can use gpsd-easy plugin to get location and show on the screen as seen above, but i could not get other plugins to use the coordinates. Wardriver and tracker seemingly would not use gpsd. I also enabled default gps plugin and had it use an address instead of a serial port.
I messed with sockets, services too so I prob got some wires crossed. :/ .
Seemingly need BlueNmea apk to kickstart using system gps???

main.plugins.fix_services.enabled = true

main.plugins.gps.enabled = true
main.plugins.gps.speed = 9600
main.plugins.gps.device = "localhost:2947"

main.plugins.gpsdeasy.enabled = true
main.plugins.gpsdeasy.bettercap = true

-- For GPS
Install BlueNmea apk
Open and start
Open kali shell in terminal and enter command 
gpsd -N -n -D5 tcp://localhost:4352

-- Open a second terminal window
source /system/xbin/monstop-nh
LD_PRELOAD=/lib/libnexmonkali.so servicectl restart bettercap

As a test to see if working correctly run..
LD_PRELOAD=/system/lib/libnexmonkali.so airodump-ng wlan0

You should see networks and possibly clients connected to them.
If it doesn't use..
source /system/xbin/monstop-nh

-- Open 3rd terminal window
source /system/xbin/monstop-nh
LD_PRELOAD=/system/lib/libnexmonkali.so pwnagotchi

If you see it's blind ctrl+c and retry.
[INFO] [epoch 1] duration=00:00:30 slept_for=00:00:30 blind=1

I have had to use various combos of..
pkill bettercap
pkill pwnagotchi
source /system/xbin/monstart-nh
source /system/xbin/monstop-nh
and testing with LD_PRELOAD=/system/lib/libnexmonkali.so airodump-ng wlan0
to get it going. Not sure why it does not always work right away even after reboots.


I tried to make a single bash script to run all these in one terminal but it no worky.
In case you wanna mess with it.

-- For a phone I use a modified 'inky.py' to enlarge the ui. I changed W to 450 and H to 500. Change config.toml to inky.
/usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/pwnagotchi/ui/hw
Then spent a couple hours adjusting in tweakview plugin lol.
